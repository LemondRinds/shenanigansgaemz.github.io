    <h2>To play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shake the grid of cubes and place it on the table. Remove the lid and push unslotted cubes into holes.</li>
            <li>For 4 minutes: each player makes a list of 4+ letter words spelled from continuous strings of cubes on the grid, connected adjacently or diagonally, using cubes once max per word.</li>
            <li>Players recite their lists in turn. Cross out non-Scrabble approved words and all words on more than one list.</li>
            <li>Remaining words are worth their length minus 3 points, except affixes which are always worth 1.</li>
            <li>Repeat until satisfied.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Affixes</h2>
        <p>Words made by tacking common prefixes or suffixes to a base word that don't form a new word with a distinct meaning are affixes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Findings" is find+ing+s, and so is an affix. It's worth 1 point.</li>
            <li>"Submarine" is sub+marine but it means something distinct from sub+marine, and so is worth the full (9 - 3 =) 6 points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common prefixes: de, dis, mis, out, over, pre, re, sub, un, under</p>
        <p>Common suffixes: s, es, ed, ied, er, ier, ing, ly, y</p>
