You could take the json/object idea and go pretty far with it, could have a set of nodes that represents html tags, attributes, classes, css, and data for the game cards all in one object and just loop over it using something like document.createElement code in onload.js

To get this running on a server locally install node js (tons of tutorials out there), navigate to website root folder, use powershell/terminal/cmd/etc and run 'node nodeServe'. It's not meant to be very stable, just something to play with if you want.
