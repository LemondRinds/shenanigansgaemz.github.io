#nav_placeholder notes would make a good candidate for readMe

- Chrome won't allow jqueries on local folders this way so the bar won't load if you just open the file directory. You can get around that to test locally with a python http server.
- In cmd, cd to the site directory. Then run python -m http.server. Then browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 


add some instructions, a how to, a table of contents, or the url of the website once you start hosting it
anything it would be nice to see when you open the repo up in git

this file uses markdown and can have tables etc i believe
~~stuff like this~~ **should work** __if i recall__

| or | a | table |
|----|----|-------|
| with | some | data |
