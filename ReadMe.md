add some instructions, a how to, a table of contents, or the url of the website once you start hosting it
anything it would be nice to see when you open the repo up in git

this file uses markdown and can have tables etc i believe
~~stuff like this~~ **should work** __if i recall__

| or | a | table |
|----|----|-------|
| with | some | data |
